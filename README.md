SIGOB is a product of the Democratic Governance Cluster of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean, which aims to strengthen management capacities for democratic governance. Governments in the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary areas, both at a central and local government level, implement the SIGOB Systems. The project has been implemented for more than 25 years in 17 countries, has worked in 14 Presidencies, 6 sub-national governments, 6 Local Governments, 3 Supreme Courts, 2 Legislative Assemblies and 23 Ministries. There are around 15 thousand employees that are part of the SIGOB management network in the region.

SIGOB assumes that governance is a method of inter-institutional political action among high-level government offices, civil society and the executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The Projects methods and procedures, supported by an IT software, strengthen internal and external transparency, the effectiveness of political action, the interaction with citizens, management strategies and constant reminder of the rule of law expressed as respect to the law system. The methodology applied aligns aspects such as public resources, political decisions, budgets, management and communicational

This methodology has resulted in several working systems that address different areas of government management:

The Management Center or Chief of Government Agenda Managing System: SIGOB implements a managing center for the President, Mayor, or Governor‚Äôs agenda. The objective of this management center is to link the strategic government agenda with the Governor‚Äôs daily activities in order to create a more transparent government. The Task Control is an important part of this working system.

The Goals System based on a result-oriented Government Action Plan: The SIGOB Regional Project uses a methodology oriented to programming and managing priority goals and creating a procedure that aligns public resources and government-society dialogue in order to achieve proposed goals. Also, this system allows citizens to hold government programs accountable for their responsibilities during presidential and virtual assemblies.

Document Transparency System: The SIGOB Project Team has implemented this system in over 30 institutions within Latin America. This Management System is intended for official correspondence; the main objective is to attain transparency and enforce a paper handling ‚Äúzero‚Äù policy. This system has had positive feedbacks from The Transparency Colombia Organization, which was implemented in Mayor‚Äôs office in Cartagena and has won the Public Transparency award for the Presidency of the Dominican Republic.

Regular Structured Process (Work flow): A Working system that has been designed to facilitate and transparent public services that are in high demand and require responses to citizen. It has been applied to administrative procedures and audit public investment processes.

Work System for Relations between Government and Society: SIGOB has developed the following triple work platform to strengthen the relations among those who govern and citizens:
a. System of communicative action: The main objective is to inform citizens about the progress of government programs and projects, as well as the problems and constraints that need to be addressed.
b. Government - Citizen Forum: Allows the management of agreed public agendas. This forum favors participation of organized population groups and the construction of agendas.
c. Monitoring system that researches media publications for actors and subjects that are important for the government.
